Validate Addresses
================================
[ShipEngine](www.shipengine.com) allows you to validate an address before using it to create a shipment to ensure
accurate delivery of your packages.

Address validation can lead to reduced shipping costs by preventing address correction
surcharges. ShipEngine cross-references multiple databases to validate addresses and identify potential delivery issues
and supports address validation for virtually every country on Earth, including the United States, Canada,
Great Britain, Australia, Germany, France, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Israel, Italy, and over 160 others.
