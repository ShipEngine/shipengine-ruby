Carrier Accounts
======================================
[ShipEngine](www.shipengine.com) allows you to connect
your own carrier accounts through the ShipEngine [dashboard](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/carriers/setup/).

A carrier account represents your account with
a specific carrier, such as FedEx, and includes the carrier's
name and code as well as your account number and any
name you have assigned to this account.
