The Official Ruby SDK for ShipEngine

# Decisions

- `minitest` over `rspec` since minitest seems to be more much popular than rspec for OSS
- `rubocop`
- Supporting Ruby 2.6 (2.5 is no longer supported by Ruby as of March 2021).

## Installation

- `bundle`

## Commands

- Run tests: `rake test`
- Lint: `rake lint`
- Autoformat: `rake fix`
